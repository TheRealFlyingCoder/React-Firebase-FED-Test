# DD FED Test

Offline FED test's are a very common thing. Hand out an unfinished solution to an agency or directly to a prospect, give them a time limit and some rules and wait for them to return their work.

*But how do you really make sure they've followed the rules? *

**That's why we are here.** 

DD FED Test utilises Firebase for Storage and Authentication, so that your application can track users, and test submissions.

## How It Works

1. Uploaded test solutions are linked to instructions and time limits
2. Users are required to log in before they can begin, and are assigned active timed tests
3. When a user completes a test they simply upload the result for your team to review

## Development Progress

- [x] Initialise the project and create a readme
- [ ] Create mocked UI
- [ ] Integrate FireStore with zip upload/download
- [ ] Integrate FireAuth for user login/authentication
- [ ] Link up complete solution
- [ ] Create usage guide
